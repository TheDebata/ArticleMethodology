    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "I cannot remember when I learned of the hot hand fallacy, but I had been of the belief that streakiness in basketball was a cognitive illusion for some time.\n",
    "\n",
    "I first learned of Miller and Sanjurjo's challenge to the hot hand fallacy in 2018 from an ESPN feature on the story titled ['He's heating up, he's on fire! Klay Thompson and the truth about the hot hand'](https://www.espn.co.uk/nba/story/_/page/presents-19573519/heating-fire-klay-thompson-truth-hot-hand-nba). As is the case for many people, I was initially pretty sceptical of their argument - but convinced myself by replicating the experiment using random numbers in Microsoft Excel. Believing I had got my head around the theory, I tried explaining (pretty unsucessfully) it to a colleague. Unpersuaded, they also decided to test it out in Microsoft Excel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following year, I started looking at the hot hand fallacy again. At that time, I was considering how the story might fit into a broader-themed feature on how our cognitive intuitions fails when conducting statistical analysis. I felt that the existing descriptions of Miller and Sanjurjo's work were failing to explain the statistical errors they uncovered in a clear way. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking back to my initial contact with the research, it occurred to me that readers might be able to follow the argument more easily if it was presented through simulations that replicated the initial experiment. That way, readers would actually be able to see the biases take effect. This was my initial motivation for the feature: to provide as clear and engaging an explanation of Miller and Sanjurjo's results as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature was first opportunity to create an interactive that challenges users' misconceptions by asking them to answer questions. Watching users try to predict the outcomes of random distributions and identify whether a pattern was or was not random convinced me that this was a powerful approach. Users appeared more engaged and likely to remember information if they had been explicitly seen it contradict their expectations."

    "### Title\n",
    "\n",
    "I came across the idea that Miller and Sanjurjo's results meant the hot hand fallacy was itself a fallacy while reading their paper ['Surprised by the Hot Hand Fallacy?A Truth in the Law of Small Numbers'](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.01265.pdf), published in Econometrica in November 2018. The paper stated that:\n",
    "\n",
    "_\"It follows from these results that the hot hand is not a myth, and that the associated belief is not a cognitive illusion. In addition, because researchers have: (i) accepted the null hypothesis that players have a fixed probability of success, and (ii) treated the mere belief in the hot hand as a cognitive illusion, the hot hand fallacy itself can be viewed as a fallacy.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The story was going to be titled The Hot Hand Fallacy Fallacy but this was changed because I had concerns that readers would mistake the title for a typo."

    "This acknowledgement is included in the publication. The quote is:\n",
    "\n",
    "_\"The failure to detect evidence of streak shooting might also be attributed to the selection of shots by individual players and the defensive strategy of opposing teams. After making one or two shots, a player may become more confident and attempt more difficult shots; after missing a shot, a player may get conservative and take only high-percentage shots. This would obscure any evidence of streak shooting in players’ performance records. The same effect may be produced by the opposing team’s defense. Once a player has made one or two shots, the opposing team may intensify their defensive pressure on that player and \"take away\" his good shots.\"_\n",

    "#### Shuffling songs in a playlist\n",
    "\n",
    "Spotify discussed their decision to move away from the Fisher-Yates algorithm in [this](https://labs.spotify.com/2014/02/28/how-to-shuffle-songs/) 2014 blog post. The method I use to shuffle songs in sequence 2 was created based on the principles outlined in this article:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Songs by the same artist are grouped together.\n",
    "Step 2: The Fisher-Yates algorithm is used to shuffle the songs within each group.\n",
    "Step 3: Each song is allocated a 'displacement value' based on the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Dvalue\\ = \\frac{\\alpha}{2\\gamma}+\\frac{4\\beta+1}{4\\gamma}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ is a random number between 0 and 1, $\\gamma$ is the number of songs in the group (i.e. number of songs by the artist, and $\\beta$ is the song's position in the group's list of shuffled songs.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the two sequences are initially shuffled, they fall into predefined positions. These positions were obtained using the  two methods but 'hard-coded' in so that I could identify specific examples of songs by the same artists clustering in sequence 1 and being space evenly in sequence 2. This is the only time where the data is not randomly generated in the browser. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the playlists are 'reshuffled' using the reshuffle button, the process occurs in browser and the playlists will be shuffled differently every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Spatial clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "For the two-dimensional plots, the truly random data (box 2) is created by generating two random numbers, one is used to place the cross horizontally and the other to place it vertically.\n",
    "\n",
    "For box 1, the map is divided into a 10 by 10 grid and then random crosses are generated but rejected if they fall within a cell that already has a cross.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Distinguishing historical stock data from random data\n",
    "\n",
    "I first became aware of Burton Malkiel's work when I read his book 'A Random Walk Down Wall Street' for a school project on the efficient market hypothesis. The efficient market hypothesis proposes that the prices of stocks and shares are constantly updated in response to new information, and therefore \"beating the market\" is very difficult. Nate Silver's book 'The Signal and the Noise' includes a clear summary of the debate over predictability in financial markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "[This](https://priceonomics.com/how-well-do-blindfolded-monkeys-play-the-stock/) article for the site Priceonomics includes the story of Malkiel and the fictitious stock data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stock price data shown in the visualisation is the daily close value for every day of trading from 1st January 2010 to the 31st December 2018 on the New York Stock Exchange. The Royal Dutch Shell data can be found [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RDS-A/history/) and the Exxon Mobile data can be found [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XOM/history/).\n",
    "\n",
    "While Malkiel's students created random walks by flipping a coin and increasing the value by 50 dollars if it landed heads and reducing it by 50 dollars if it landed tails, I found that this method made the random charts reasonably easy to discern from real data. This is because real prices fluctuate erratically, their value does not change by the same amount every day. The formula I used for generating the random data mimics this volatility. It is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Yvalue_{n+1} = Yvalue_{n}+10\\alpha $$\n",
    "\n",

    "I thought I had come up with the bus idea as a tangible example of asymmetric in experiment design spontaneously until I reread my notes and discovered the following excerpt from Thomas Gilovich's book 'How We Know What Isn't So':\n",
    "\n",
    "_\"The belief that 'the bus always seems to be heading in the wrong direction' is particularly interesting in this regard because of an important asymmetry between positive and negative events: Certain kinds of negative events can accumulate in ways that positive events cannot. I can become convinced that all the buses are headed in the wrong direction by observing quite a number headed the wrong way before I encounter one going in my direction. Note that the opposite cannot happen: Unless I have difficulty boarding, I never observe several going my way before 1 discover one headed in the opposite direction. If a bus is going in my direction, I take it. Because of this asymmetry, we can experience a certain kind of 'bad streak,' but not a complementary streak of good fortune. To those who fail to recognize this fact, events can sometimes seem to be conspiring against them.\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "Gilovich comes tantalisingly close to identifying the asymmetry error. He recognises that certain conditions of observation mean positive outcomes will cluster together while negative outcomes will not, but fails to spot the implications of this for his own research."

    "### Why do injuries and teammates create dependencies between consecutive shots?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Basketball players are not random processes like coin flips – we would expect their shooting, at least subtly, to be affected by a variety of factors: a player’s confidence, motivation, the quality and fit of their teammates, the defender’s ability, the tactics deployed by each team, injuries, fatigue and illness. If these factors create a dependency between consecutive shots (which they theoretically should), we will get hot and cold hands.\n",

    "Houston Rockets point guard Russell Westbrook entered the 2019/20 season in a new team, coming off two summer surgeries and with multiple dislocated fingers on his shooting hand. Before the turn of the year, Westbrook shot 49.1% from two-point range. But as his injuries healed and he became more comfortable in a new role, he improved. From the beginning of January to the suspension of the league, Westbrook scored on 52.4% of his two-point shots. \n",
    "\n",
    "This difference is small (although in a sport where each team takes approximately ninety shots per game and point differentials are regularly in the single digits, small changes can have big impacts) and much of the variation may well be down to luck. However, it is reasonable to assume that Westbrook’s health had some impact on his shooting ability. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we pick a random shot $n$ from Westbrook’s season. If the shot occurred before the new year (i.e. when Westbrook was injured), the shot $n-1$ also occurred before the new year. Therefore, his injury creates a dependency between shots. If he missed the previous shot $(n-1)$, there is a higher probability that the shot occurred in 2019 when Westbrook was shooting worse, and so he is also more likely to miss shot $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the outcome of the previous shot gives a hint to the possible outcome of the next shot – this is the hot hand.\n",

To put it another way, there is little debate that a “cold hand” can exist: It is no surprise that a player will be less successful if he or she is sick, or injured, or playing against excellent defense. Occasional periods  of  poor  performance  will  manifest  themselves  as  a  small  positive  time  correlation when data are aggregated.\"_\n",

It seems, intuitively, that if you shine a bright enough light into the fog, if there was an army out there you’d have to be able to see it — but in fact you can’t. That’s where we are: we’re trying to see if there’s an army out there, and we have confident reports that the coast is clear — but we may have underestimated the density of the fog. The randomness of the data is the fog. What I am saying in this article is that the fog may be many times more dense than we have been allowing for. Let’s look again; let’s give the fog a little more credit. Let’s not be too sure that we haven’t been missing something important._\n",

This is sometimes true. But we should have some humility. We are looking at 0s and 1s, the player and the coach have a far richer information set.\"\n",

Because our samples were fairly large, I don’t believe this changes the original conclusions about the hot hand.\"_ Two years later, in 2017, Gilovich told ESPN, _People with tremendous math skills are all over the map on this one.

    "_So let's be really precise with that, when you say there is no link, there's not even a slight improvement, \"hey - I'm loose, I'm hitting shots, I'm feeling good\". What is the correlation with future success whether I made a few in a row or I missed a few in a row?_\n",

    "Tom Gilovich:\n",

    "_Two things are important there. 1 is there may be some ways in which you've experienced some success, you feel different, and it might influence your future behaviour we haven't studied, we've put aside from the hot hand idea...What we did look at - do you become a better shooter? Not do you take more shots, you probably do take more shots because you're feeling hot. The question is are you more likely to make a shot after having succeeded in the past versus having failed and the data show, and this remains controversial, for 30 years there's been back and forth - all the challenges to it for decades have not stood up, there's a recent challenge that is among the more interesting ones, so I have to say it remains controversial - our original hypothesis isn't controversial, that is to say people wildly overestimate the extent to which people are hot or how streaky people are. Whether's there's any sort of carry over. That remains a bit controversial._\n",
