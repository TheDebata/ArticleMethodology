    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "I first learned about this story the day after Question Time aired on BBC One, when the BBC reality check team published [this](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/50517136) article. I liked the article as an opportunistic move that used a viral moment to provide people with better data on the UK income distribution. However, the Question Time incident itself initially seemed pretty unremarkable - it could easily be headlined _\"one man in sample of one-hundred people significantly misjudges the UK income distribution\"_ - not an earth-shaking or even particularly surprising discovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "But later that week I came across [this tweet](https://twitter.com/mattsmithetc/status/1197812093443067904) from Matthew Smith, a data journalist at YouGov, which shows that people's definition of 'richness' changes as their income levels change. While most people seemed to be judging the £80,000 man as an isolated bit-of-a-plonker, YouGov's data demonstrated that his views were actually more consistent with a typical high-income individual that you might intuitively expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Harvard psychologist Dan Ariely coined the term \"predictably irrational\" to describe human behaviours that are neither rational nor erratic and random. These behaviours are key to the disciplines of cognitive psychology and behavioural economics. If people's beliefs are scattered randomly around the objective truth, there's not much to be done other that warn those people against overconfidence. But if we can identify the systematic mistakes that lead person after person to the same erroneous beliefs, people can adjust their behaviour and form new cognitive strategies to mitigate these mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Systematic mistakes are also particularly incidious. Where belief's scatter around the truth at random, better decisions can be made by pooling the views of multiple people (so that, in the long-run, one misconception balances out another). But when everyone is making the same mistakes, we cannot arrive at better decisions and beliefs without behavioural change (even more importantly, systematic errors can be exploited on a mass scale - think of cult followings, advertising and even fascism). \n",
    "\n",
    "To me, YouGov's data transformed the Question Time story from one of random misperception to one of predictable irrationality. As I researched the subject, I discovered that Labour's tax policy was designed specifically to tip-toe around these misperceptions of medium- to high-income earners. The idea that a policy belonging to the more liberal of the two potential governing parties was being determined, in part, by the systematic misjudgments of the country's wealthiest citizens seemed problematic and a story worth telling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, our misjudgments of 'richness' are not purely the product of biases; most people simply do not have a good feel for how much income and wealth other people have. Therefore, I wanted the feature to also provide a nuanced look at inequality in the UK."

    "The marginal tax rates for income tax and national insurance are taken from the [government website](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/rates-and-thresholds-for-employers-2020-to-2021). From the 19/20 financial year to 20/21 income tax rates (unusually) remained constant, but the threshold for paying national insurance contributions increased from £8,632 to £9,500. \n",
    "\n",
    "It was important to include national insurance because this is an often overlooked component of the tax system. Too regularly, we evaluate the progressivity of the tax system by only considering income tax bands, forgetting the impact of the regressive national insurance tax (ideally we would also consider sales taxes - VAT is regressive since low-income earners spend a higher percentage of their income on essential goods and services, while stamp duty and council tax are both broadly progressive).\n",
    "\n",
    "Present calculations of take-home pay for every single permutation of a person's circumstances - do they live in Scotland or England; are they self-employed or PAYE; are they earning through dividends; are they married, blind or over seventy-five - was clear impractical, so it was necessary to establish a 'typical' individual for calculation purposes. The visualisation shows take-home pay during the 20/21 financial year for a person whose personal allowance extends to £12,500 (this figure can vary depending on personal circumstances), and whose entire earnings come through PAYE employment.\n",
